	<p>Approach this plate of the light yellow heap of rice with caution. Once you have tasted it, 
	you might not like Biryani made in any other region. This is the only Biryani recipe in Kerala cuisine, and sometimes one is more than enough.
	 Rice and chicken are cooked with a unique blend of Indian spices that are commonly seen in every household of Kerala are cooked in a vessel sealed
	 with dum (made of atta and water).</p>
	<p>The rice is a unique small fragrant one, unlike Basmati rice that is used widely to make Biryani.
	 What makes Thalassery Biryani distinct from other Indian Biryani recipes is the use of a paste of fried onions called Bisht. 	
	Dum cooking is an old technique of slow cooking in which the vessel mysteroids is placed over fire and coal is placed over the lid,	
	 which stops the steam from escaping. The result is rice and succulent chicken that is cooked to perfection in its own juice and spices.</p>
